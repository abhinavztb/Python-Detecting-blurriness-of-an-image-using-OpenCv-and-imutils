# Python-Detecting-blurriness-of-an-image-using-OpenCv-and-imutils
Python: Detecting blurriness of an image using OpenCv and imutils -importing all images in a folder,viewing there blurriness parameter and writing the new images into a folder where python file is saved 

# I have used Anaconda3 and Spyder IDE for implementing the program
# For using the program directly -NOTE 2 IMPORTANT POINTS-
# 1) Install Opencv and Imutils by pip install .
# 2) Give arguments in console (using Ctrl+F6 in Spyder and in Console Arguments ) , use format: --images "path of folder"
# 3) For blurriness We have to set a threshold on our clarity purpose : by default value it is 100
